 Project Description: In this web development project, you will create an image slider or carousel
 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An image slider is a common component used to display a
 series of images in a visually appealing way, and it's a valuable skill for any front-end developer.
 This project will help you practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while creating an
 interactive user interface.
 Project Requirements:
 HTMLStructure: Create the HTML structure for the image slider. You should have a
 container for the slider, navigation buttons (previous and next), and a section to display
 the images.
 CSS Styling: Style the image slider using CSS. This includes defining the size, positioning,
 and transitions for the images and navigation buttons. Ensure that the slider looks visually
 appealing and is responsive.
 Image Array: Prepare an array of at least 5 images that will be displayed in the slider. You
 can use any image of your choice; make sure they are appropriately sized.
 JavaScript Functionality: Implement the JavaScript logic for the image slider. You should
 create functions to:
 ● Display the first image when the page loads.
 ● Allowusers to click on "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the
 images.
 ● Loopbacktothe first image after reaching the last one.
 Automatic Slideshow: Add an option to make the slider automatically transition to the
 next image after a certain interval (e.g., every 3 seconds).

User Experience: Ensure that the user experience is smooth and intuitive. Images should
 transition with a pleasing animation, and the slider should provide feedback to users
 about their current position.
 Documentation: Include comments in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to explain
 the functionality and purpose of each part of the project.
